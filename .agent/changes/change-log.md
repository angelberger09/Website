## 2026-06-23 22:40 ET — Minimal studio homepage

### Changed

- Replaced technical demo homepage copy.

- Added Pages folder menu.
- Added scroll title sequence.
- Added four minimal destination cards.

### Why

The homepage needed to feel like a real minimal public studio homepage instead of a repo/data viewer.

## 2026-06-23 22:55 ET — Public agent memory system

### Changed

- Added root `agent.md`.
- Added root `start-here.md`.
- Added `.agent/` project memory folder.
- Added matrices, lessons, maps, change templates, and reusable templates.

### Why

Future site work needs a public-safe memory layer for intent, feedback lessons, semantic items, decisions, and quality checks.

## 2026-06-23 23:03 ET — Feedback-to-lesson workflow

### Changed

- Added `.agent/feedback/` documentation.
- Added intake, extraction, public-safety, workflow, inbox, and examples files.
- Updated root `agent.md` to route future feedback through the workflow.
- Updated `.agent/start-here.md`, `.agent/README.md`, and active lessons.

### Why

Small feedback points should be easy to convert into public-safe reusable lessons without storing raw private context.

## 2026-06-23 23:10 ET — Visual atmosphere and tactile depth feedback

### Changed

- Added timestamped `.agent/feedback/feedback-log.md` entry for static-structure feedback.
- Added timestamped feedback entry for tactile polaroid/photo-like depth.
- Added LESSON-005 through LESSON-010 to lesson log and active lessons.
- Added proposed design items for gradient fade-offs, flat cel-shaded atmosphere, animated texture, and tactile polaroid depth.
- Added proposed interaction items for mouse-reactive background and gloss/scratch overlay response.
- Added metrics for alive-but-not-busy, flat-but-tactile, and borders-not-primary-structure.
- Added DEC-006 to evaluate anime.js before implementation.

### Why

The current homepage is clear but feels too static, empty, and framed. The next direction should reduce hard borders, add intentional motion, and create tactile 2.5D material depth while staying flat and performant.

## 2026-06-23 23:30 ET — Header offscreen top emergence feedback

### Changed

- Added a public-safe feedback record for the header placement screenshot.
- Added LESSON-011 for making the header feel like it emerges from offscreen above the page.
- Added DESIGN-011 Offscreen Top Emergence.
- Added INT-008 Top Edge Entry.
- Added METRIC-010 Offscreen But Usable.
- Added a reference note and encoded compressed screenshot reference in `.agent/references/`.
- Updated active lessons, feedback lesson mapping, design language, components, memory, semantic index, and relationship map.

### Why

The current header reads as a complete floating pill inside the page. The next header direction should use the viewport top edge as part of the composition so the header feels tucked, entering, or emerging from above while still remaining fully usable.

## 2026-06-23 23:45 ET — Atmosphere assets and border/card alignment pass

### Changed

- Added five reusable atmosphere assets to `public/atmosphere/`.
- Added a homepage atmosphere layer using grain, dust, scratches, and gloss overlays.
- Reduced hard borders on the header, folder menu, homepage cards, reader cards, and source links.
- Rebuilt card separation with gradients, material layers, soft shadows, and inset highlights.
- Improved page-card alignment with equal-height cards, consistent rows, and bottom-aligned descriptions.
- Added `.agent/matrices/assets.matrix.md` and semantic index rows for ASSET-001 through ASSET-005.

### Why

The site needed to apply the feedback lessons directly: less hard framed UI, more tactile atmosphere, visible material depth, and cleaner card alignment without relying on borders.

## 2026-06-23 23:55 ET — Header edge attachment fix

### Changed

- Fixed the header CSS so `.floating-header` remains `position: fixed` instead of being overwritten by a later grouped selector.
- Moved the header slightly offscreen at the top edge.
- Changed the header from a complete floating pill to a top-attached material tab with rounded lower corners.
- Preserved readable controls and mobile behavior.

### Why

The screenshot showed that the new atmosphere was visible, but the header still read like a complete pill floating inside the page. This pass applies LESSON-011 more directly while keeping the site usable.

## 2026-06-23 23:40 ET — Left-expanding open menu feedback

### Changed

- Added a public-safe feedback record for the Pages menu screenshot.
- Added LESSON-013 for making the Pages menu open by default, expand left, and stay visually unboxed.
- Added DESIGN-012 Unboxed Left-Expanding Menu.
- Added INT-010 Leftward Default-Open Menu Reveal.
- Added METRIC-012 Open Left Without Panel.
- Added a reference note and encoded compressed screenshot reference in `.agent/references/`.
- Updated active lessons, feedback lesson mapping, design language, components, interactions, memory, semantic index, and relationship map.

### Why

The current Pages menu opens downward into a large separate panel. The next menu direction should integrate the links into the header line, default open on desktop, expand left from the Pages control, and avoid separate border/background treatment.
