# Start Here

This is the public website repo for Soft Strange Studio, Angel Berger's minimal studio homepage and page shell.

## What this site is

The site is the public front door for studio work, notes, portfolio pieces, and future store links. It now owns filled Website pages instead of only pointing at raw data or future routes.

## Current page shape

- `/Website/` is the studio landing page with a scroll title and four page doors.
- `/Website/about/` introduces the public studio shape and what belongs here.
- `/Website/notes/` renders published public notes from the Blog repo inside the Website shell.
- `/Website/notes/post/?slug=...` renders individual notes inside the Website reader.
- `/Website/portfolio/` presents the first public project/archive cards.
- `/Website/store/` presents prepared product lanes for future shop links.
- `/Website/blog/` and `/Website/blog/post/?slug=...` remain compatibility routes for the same notes reader.

## Connected repos

- `Blog` provides public notes pages and a `posts.json` feed.
- `Portfolio` is reserved for future public project data.
- `Store` is reserved for future public product data.

## Before editing

- the matching matrix file for the changed item
- `.agent/lessons/active-lessons.md` if feedback created a new rule
- `.agent/web/relationship-map.md` if connections changed
